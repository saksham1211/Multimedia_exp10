Click on the link to browse my website:- https://saksham1211.github.io/Multimedia_exp10/

It's a simple responsive website which contains all the Multimedia Projects which I made as part of my Multimedia semester VI curriculum.
Made using easy HTML and CSS scripts.
All projects are stored on google drive which can be easily accessed from the website.
